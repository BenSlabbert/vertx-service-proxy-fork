= Vert.x Service Proxy
:toc: left

When you compose a vert.x application, you may want to isolate a functionality somewhere and make it available to
the rest of your application.

That's the main purpose of service proxies. It lets you expose a _service_ on the
event bus, so, any other vert.x component can consume it, as soon as they know the _address_ on which the service
is published.

A _service_ is described with a Java interface containing methods following the _async pattern_. Behind the hood,
messages are sent on the event bus to invoke the service and get the response back. But to make it more easy to use
for you, it generates a _proxy_ that you can invoke directly (using the API  from the service interface).


== Using vert.x service proxies

To use the Vert.x Service Proxies, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of
your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-service-proxy</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-service-proxy:3.3.0-SNAPSHOT'
----

Be aware that as the service proxy mechanism relies on code generation, so modifications to the _service interface_
require to re-compile the sources to regenerate the code.

To generate the proxies in different languages, you will need to add the _language_ dependency such as
`vertx-lang-groovy` for Groovy....

== Introduction to service proxies

Let's have a look to service proxies and why they can be useful. Let's imagine you have a _database service_
exposed on the event bus, you should do something like this:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject message = new JsonObject();
message.put("collection", "mycollection")
    .put("document", new JsonObject().put("name", "tim"));
DeliveryOptions options = new DeliveryOptions().addHeader("action", "save");
vertx.eventBus().send("database-service-address", message, options, res2 -> {
  if (res2.succeeded()) {
    // done
  } else {
    // failure
  }
});
----

When creating a service there's a certain amount of boilerplate code to listen on the event bus for incoming
messages, route them to the appropriate method and return results on the event bus.

With Vert.x service proxies, you can avoid writing all that boilerplate code and concentrate on writing your service.

You write your service as a Java interface and annotate it with the `@ProxyGen` annotation, for example:

[source,java]
----
@ProxyGen
public interface SomeDatabaseService {

  // A couple of factory methods to create an instance and a proxy
  static SomeDatabaseService create(Vertx vertx) {
    return new SomeDatabaseServiceImpl(vertx);
  }

  static SomeDatabaseService createProxy(Vertx vertx,
    String address) {
    return new SomeDatabaseServiceVertxEBProxy(vertx, address);
  }

 // Actual service operations here...
 void save(String collection, JsonObject document,
   Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> resultHandler);
}
----

Given the interface, Vert.x will generate all the boilerplate code required to access your service over the event
bus, and it will also generate a *client side proxy* for your service, so your clients can use a rich idiomatic
API for your service instead of having to manually craft event bus messages to send. The client side proxy will
work irrespective of where your service actually lives on the event bus (potentially on a different machine).

That means you can interact with your service like this:

[source,java]
----
SomeDatabaseService service = SomeDatabaseService.createProxy(vertx,
    "database-service-address");

// Save some data in the database - this time using the proxy
service.save("mycollection", new JsonObject().put("name", "tim"), res2 -> {
  if (res2.succeeded()) {
    // done
  }
});
----

You can also combine `@ProxyGen` with language API code generation (`@VertxGen`) in order to create service stubs
in any of the languages supported by Vert.x - this means you can write your service once in Java and interact with it
through an idiomatic other language API irrespective of whether the service lives locally or is somewhere else on
the event bus entirely. For this don't forget to add the dependency on your language in your build descriptor:

[source, java]
----
@ProxyGen // Generate service proxies
@VertxGen // Generate the clients
public interface SomeDatabaseService {
  // ...
}
----

== Async Interface

To be used by the service-proxy generation, the _service interface_ must comply to a couple of rules. First it
should follow the async pattern. To return result, the method should declare a
`Handler<AsyncResult<ResultType>>`. `ResultType` can be another proxy (and so a proxies can be factories for other
proxies.

Let's see an example

[source,java]
----
@ProxyGen
public interface SomeDatabaseService {

 // A couple of factory methods to create an instance and a proxy

 static SomeDatabaseService create(Vertx vertx) {
   return new SomeDatabaseServiceImpl(vertx);
 }

 static SomeDatabaseService createProxy(Vertx vertx, String address) {
   return new SomeDatabaseServiceVertxEBProxy(vertx, address);
 }

 // A method notifying the completion without a result (void)
 void save(String collection, JsonObject document,
   Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> result);

 // A method providing a result (a json object)
 void findOne(String collection, JsonObject query,
   Handler<AsyncResult<JsonObject>> result);

 // Create a connection
 void createConnection(String shoeSize,
   Handler<AsyncResult<MyDatabaseConnection>> resultHandler);

}
----

with:

[source,java]
----
@ProxyGen
@VertxGen
public interface MyDatabaseConnection {

 void insert(JsonObject someData);

 void commit(Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> resultHandler);

 @ProxyClose
 void close();
}
----

You can also declare that a particular method unregisters the proxy by annotating it with the `@ProxyClose`
annotation. The proxy instance is disposed when this method is called.

More constraints on the _service interfaces_ are described below.

## Code generation

Service annotated with `@ProxyGen` annotation trigger the generation of the service helper classes:

- The service proxy: a compile time generated proxy that uses the `EventBus` to interact with the service via messages
- The service handler: a compile time generated `EventBus` handler that reacts to events sent by the proxy

Generated proxies and handlers are named after the service class, for example if the service is named `MyService`
the handler is called `MyServiceProxyHandler` and the proxy is called `MyServiceEBProxy`.

The _codegen_ annotation processor generates these classes at compilation time. It is a feature of the Java
compiler so _no extra step_ is required, it is just a matter of configuring correctly the compiler.


Here a configuration example for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <annotationProcessors>
      <annotationProcessor>io.vertx.codegen.CodeGenProcessor</annotationProcessor>
    </annotationProcessors>
    <compilerArgs>
      <arg>-AoutputDirectory=${project.basedir}/src/main</arg>
    </compilerArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

This feature can also be used in Gradle, or even in IDE as they provide usually support for annotation
processors.

## Exposing your service

Once you have your _service interface_, compile the source to generate the stub and proxies. Then, you need some
code to "register" your service on the event bus:

[source, java]
----
SomeDatabaseService service = new SomeDatabaseServiceImpl();
// Register the handler
ProxyHelper.registerService(SomeDatabaseService.class, vertx, service,
    "database-service-address");
----

This can be done in a verticle, or anywhere in your code.

Once registered, the service becomes accessible. If you are running your application on a cluster, the service is
available from any host.

To withdraw your service, use the `ProxyHelper.unregisterService`
method:

[source, java]
----
SomeDatabaseService service = new SomeDatabaseServiceImpl();
// Register the handler
MessageConsumer<JsonObject> consumer = ProxyHelper.registerService(SomeDatabaseService.class, vertx, service,
    "database-service-address");

// ....

// Unregister your service.
ProxyHelper.unregisterService(consumer);
----

## Proxy creation

Now that the service is exposed, you probably want to consume it. For this, you need to create a proxy. The proxy
can be created using the `ProxyHelper` class:

[source, java]
----
SomeDatabaseService service = ProxyHelper.createProxy(SomeDatabaseService.class,
    vertx,
    "database-service-address");
// or with delivery options:
SomeDatabaseService service2 = ProxyHelper.createProxy(SomeDatabaseService.class,
    vertx,
    "database-service-address", options);
----

The second method takes an instance of `link:../../vertx-core/dataobjects.html#DeliveryOptions[DeliveryOptions]` where you con configure the
message delivery (such as the timeout).

Alternatively, you can use the generated proxy class. The proxy class name is the _service interface_ class name
followed by `VertxEBProxy`. For instance, if your _service interface_ is named `SomeDatabaseService`, the proxy
class is named `SomeDatabaseServiceVertxEBProxy`.

Generally, _service interface_ contains a `createProxy` static method to create the proxy. But this is not required:

[source,java]
----
@ProxyGen
public interface SomeDatabaseService {

 // Method to create the proxy.
 static SomeDatabaseService createProxy(Vertx vertx, String address) {
   return new SomeDatabaseServiceVertxEBProxy(vertx, address);
 }

 // ...
}
----

## Restrictions for service interface

There are restrictions on the types and return values that can be used in a service method so that these are easy to
marshall over event bus messages and so they can be used asynchronously. They are:

### Return types

Must be one of

* `void`
* `@Fluent` and return reference to the service (`this`):

[source,java]
----
@Fluent
SomeDatabaseService doSomething();
----

This is because methods must not block and it's not possible to return a result immediately without blocking if
the service is remote.

#### Parameter types

Let `JSON` = `JsonObject | JsonArray`
Let `PRIMITIVE` = Any primitive type or boxed primitive type

Parameters can be any of:

* `JSON`
* `PRIMITIVE`
* `List<JSON>`
* `List<PRIMITIVE>`
* `Set<JSON>`
* `Set<PRIMITIVE>`
* `Map<String, JSON>`
* `Map<String, PRIMITIVE>`
* Any _Enum_ type
* Any class annotated with `@DataObject`

If an asynchronous result is required a last parameter of type `Handler<AsyncResult<R>>` can be provided.

`R` can be any of:

* `JSON`
* `PRIMITIVE`
* `List<JSON>`
* `List<PRIMITIVE>`
* `Set<JSON>`
* `Set<PRIMITIVE>`
* Any _Enum_ type
* Any class annotated with `@DataObject`
* Another proxy

### Overloaded methods

There must be no overloaded service methods. (_i.e._ more than one with the same name, regardless the signature).

## Convention for invoking services over the event bus (without proxies)

Service Proxies assume that event bus messages follow a certain format so they can be used to invoke services.

Of course, you don't *have to* use client proxies to access remote service if you don't want to. It's perfectly acceptable
to interact with them by just sending messages over the event bus.

In order for services to be interacted with a consistent way the following message formats *must be used* for any
Vert.x services.

The format is very simple:

* There should be a header called `action` which gives the name of the action to perform.
* The body of the message should be a `JsonObject`, there should be one field in the object for each argument needed by the action.

For example to invoke an action called `save` which expects a String collection and a JsonObject document:

----
Headers:
    "action": "save"
Body:
    {
        "collection", "mycollection",
        "document", {
            "name": "tim"
        }
    }
----

The above convention should be used whether or not service proxies are used to create services, as it allows services
to be interacted with consistently.

In the case where service proxies are used the "action" value should map to the name of an action method in the
service interface and each `[key, value]` in the body should map to a `[arg_name, arg_value]` in the action method.

For return values the service should use the `message.reply(...)` method to send back a return value - this can be of
any type supported by the event bus. To signal a failure the method `message.fail(...)` should be used.

If you are using service proxies the generated code will handle this for you automatically.
